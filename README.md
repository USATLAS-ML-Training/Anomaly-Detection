#Anomaly detection using autoencoder

This repository is a fork of the original [ADC2021 data challenge on anomaly detection at 40 MHz](https://mpp-hep.github.io/ADC2021/). This tutorial was modified to best suit the [US ATLAS Machine Learning Training Event 2022](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1169324/)

This tutorial will cover:

1. Examples of model architectures using autoencoders for anomaly detection
2. How to train the model
3. Compute the model predictions on background data
4. Compute the model predictions on signal (anomalies)
5. Evaluate model's performance using 2 different techniques
