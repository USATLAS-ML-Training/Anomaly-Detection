# ADC2021

In this repository you will find code examples for the following:
1. How to load background dataset
2. Examples of define model architectures for anomaly detection
3. How to train the model
4. Compute the model predictions on background data
5. Compute the model predictions on signal (anomalies)
6. Evaluate model's performance using 2 different techniques
7. Evaluate the number of floating point operations of the model

This information can be found in three different scripts:

1. **Convolutional_AE.ipynb**: Load the data, define a convolutional autoencoder and evaluate it's performance
2. **Dense_AE.ipynb.ipynb**: Load the data, define a fully connected dense autoencoder and evaluate it's performance
3. **computeFLOPs.ipynb**: Compute the number of floating point operations for a given model
